POST 1:
💰 SHOCKING TRUTH: Rich Indians Are 4X More Likely to Be Obese

New data shows:
• Wealthiest Indians: 38.6% obesity
• Poorest Indians: 10.0% obesity

Your money is buying:
❌ Processed food instead of home-cooked meals
❌ Car rides instead of walking
❌ Convenience instead of health

It's time to invest in health, not just wealth.

Target: Urban professionals, ages 20-40
Platform: Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn

POST 1:
🏙️ URBAN DANGER ALERT

City dwellers have 69% HIGHER obesity rates than villages!

Why?
• Desk jobs = No movement
• Metro commutes = No walking
• Food delivery = No home cooking
• Stress = Comfort eating

Your city won't make you healthy. YOU have to.

Take the stairs. Pack your lunch. Walk to nearby places.

POST 2:
Your grandparents in villages: Walked 10 km/day 🚶
You in the city: Walk 100 meters 🚗

Their diet: Dal-roti-sabzi 🥘
Your diet: Burger-pizza-coke 🍔

Their obesity rate: 19.7%
Your obesity rate: 33.3%

It's not genetics. It's lifestyle.

You don't notice gaining 0.5 kg per year.

POST 2:
Think you're maintaining your weight? 🤔

Check again.

Most people gain 1-2 kg per year without noticing.

Your jeans get tight → You buy bigger jeans
Your belt loosens → You move the buckle
Your photos change → You avoid cameras

STOP ignoring the signs.
Weigh yourself. Face the truth. Act now.

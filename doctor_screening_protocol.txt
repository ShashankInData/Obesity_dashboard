Screening Protocol:
✓ BMI calculation at EVERY visit
✓ Waist circumference measurement
✓ Blood pressure (every visit)

✓ Lipid panel (biannually)
✓ Liver function tests (annually)
✓ Sleep apnea screening if BMI > 30

MEDIUM RISK PATIENTS (Screen annually)

Demographic Profile:
- Urban residents aged 25-34
- Rural residents aged 35-44
- Wealth quintile 2-3
- Mixed activity occupation

Screening Protocol:
✓ BMI calculation (annual)
✓ Blood pressure (annual)
✓ Fasting glucose (annual)
✓ Lipid panel (every 2 years)

LOW RISK PATIENTS (Screen biennially)

Demographic Profile:
- Rural residents aged 15-29
- Wealth quintile 1
- High physical activity occupation (agriculture, manual labor)

Screening Protocol:
✓ BMI calculation (every 2 years)
✓ Blood pressure (every 2 years)
✓ Basic metabolic screening only if symptomatic

================================================================================

AGE-SPECIFIC INTERVENTION POINTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERVENTION: If BMI > 25, refer to dietitian/lifestyle program

AGE 35-49: COMPLICATION PREVENTION PHASE
Current obesity: 34.0-37.0%
Primary Goal: Prevent diabetes, CVD, other complications

Counseling Points:
- "Focus on health metrics, not just weight"
- Screen aggressively for complications
- Medication if lifestyle changes fail
- Consider bariatric surgery if BMI > 35 with comorbidities

MANDATORY SCREENING:
- Diabetes screening (annual)
- Cardiovascular risk assessment
- Fatty liver screening
- Joint health evaluation

SOCIOECONOMIC-TAILORED COUNSELING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR WEALTHY/UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS PATIENTS (Quintile 4-5)
Risk Profile: 38.6% obesity rate

Your Message:
"Your lifestyle puts you at HIGH risk. You have advantages - use them:

 ✓ You can afford a personal trainer - HIRE ONE
 ✓ You can afford gym membership - USE IT
 ✓ You can afford healthy food delivery - ORDER IT
 ✓ You can afford regular health check-ups - SCHEDULE THEM

 Money gives you options. Choose health over convenience.
 Your desk job won't kill you if you're intentional about activity."

Key Barriers to Address:
- "Too busy" excuse (they're busy being sedentary)
- Over-reliance on convenience (car, delivery, processed food)
- Social eating (business dinners, celebrations)
- Stress eating patterns

FOR LOWER-INCOME PATIENTS (Quintile 1-2)
Risk Profile: 10.0% obesity rate

Your Message:
"Your traditional lifestyle is actually PROTECTIVE:

 ✓ Home-cooked food > restaurant food
 ✓ Walking/cycling > driving
 ✓ Physical labor > desk work
 ✓ Traditional diet > Western diet

 Don't aspire to wealthy people's food habits.
 You're healthier in many ways. Maintain this!"

Key Barriers to Address:
- Aspiration to "wealthy lifestyle" (processed foods as status symbol)
- Limited healthcare access (provide free/subsidized options)
- Time constraints (simple, quick healthy options)

FOR URBAN PATIENTS
Risk Profile: 33.3% obesity (69% higher than rural)

Your Message:
"Urban living is a major risk factor. Your environment works against you:

 ✗ Sedentary commute
 ✗ Desk job
 ✗ Easy access to unhealthy food
 ✗ High stress

 You MUST compensate with intentional activity and food choices."

Specific Recommendations:
- Walk/metro/bike instead of car for trips < 5 km
- Use standing desk or take breaks every 30 min
- Pack lunch from home 4-5 days/week
- Join walking groups or fitness classes for social support

FOR RURAL PATIENTS
Risk Profile: 19.7% obesity

Your Message:
"Your lifestyle is generally protective. Focus on:
 ✓ Maintaining current activity levels
 ✓ Avoiding processed/packaged foods
 ✓ Limiting sugar intake
 ✓ Screening if family history present"

                     UNDERSTANDING OBESITY IN INDIA
                    Patient Education Handout
                    Based on DHS Survey Data 2019-21
================================================================================

THE WEALTH TRAP: More Money = More Health Risk

Did you know?
- Richest Indians: 38.6% obesity rate
- Poorest Indians: 10.0% obesity rate
- That's NEARLY 4X HIGHER risk if you're wealthy!

If you can afford these, you're at HIGHER risk:
[ ] Processed/fast food daily
[ ] Car instead of walking
[ ] Desk job with no physical labor
[ ] Restaurant meals multiple times per week

ACTION STEP: Track your steps. Aim for 10,000 steps per day.
Walking is free - use it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE URBAN DANGER: City Life is Making You Sick

The data is clear:
- Urban obesity: 33.3%
- Rural obesity: 19.7%
- Urban areas are 69% MORE at risk!

Why cities are dangerous:
1. Sedentary office jobs (vs agricultural work)
2. Easy access to processed food
3. Car/metro commute (vs walking)
4. Higher stress leading to comfort eating

ACTION STEP: If you live in a city, you MUST intentionally add physical
activity. It won't happen naturally like in villages.

Daily urban survival plan:
- Take stairs instead of elevator (every time!)
- Walk/cycle for trips under 2 km
- Stand and stretch every 30 minutes at desk
- Pack home-cooked lunch instead of eating out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE AGE CREEP: You're Gaining Weight Without Noticing

Obesity rates by age (women):
- Age 15-19: 5.4%
- Age 20-24: 12.2%
- Age 25-29: 21.5%
- Age 30-34: 29.9%
- Age 35-39: 34.0%
- Age 40-44: 36.8%
- Age 45-49: 37.0%

This happens SLOWLY. You don't notice 0.3% gain per year.
But over 20 years, you could be 20 kg heavier!

ACTION STEP: Weigh yourself on the 1st of every month.
If you gain 2+ kg in 6 months, change something NOW.

Warning signs:
- Clothes getting tighter
- Belt moving one notch out
- Feeling breathless climbing stairs
- Fatigue even with adequate sleep

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE EPIDEMIC: India's Obesity Crisis 1998 vs 2021

Children: 2.8% → 3.4%
Women: 10.7% → 24.0%
Men: 9.7% → 23.7%

This isn't genetic. This is lifestyle change.

Traditional Indian diet + active lifestyle = LOW obesity
Western diet + sedentary lifestyle = HIGH obesity

ACTION STEP: Return to traditional eating patterns
Dal, roti, sabzi > burgers, pizza, sweets

Traditional foods that protect you:
- Whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat)
- Lentils and legumes (dal, rajma, chana)
- Fresh vegetables (sabzi)
- Limited processed foods
- Spices with health benefits (turmeric, ginger)

Foods that harm you:
- Deep fried snacks
- Sugary drinks (soda, packaged juices)
- Bakery items (cakes, pastries)
- Fast food (burgers, pizza)
- Excessive sweets/mithai
